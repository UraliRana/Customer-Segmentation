# Customer-Segmentation

In this project, we developed a customer segmentation application using a K-means clustering, which is the essential algorithm for clustering unlabeled datasets. Before the above procedure, data preprocessing tasks like normalize the data and clean the
missing value can perform. The mall customer segmentation data-set use to segment the customer based on similar behavior. Finally, We may often want to analyze each segment separately as they may behave differently. After analysis, the companies can
find targeted people for special offers according to their behavior patterns.

*Steps for execution:

Extracted the Data
Perfromed EDA for the different features to check how they ar correlated.
Perfromed Feature Scaling using MinMaxScaler.
Perfromed a train_train_split for the data to split it into 75% training and 25% testing data.
Created a Machine Learning Model using Kmeans Algorithm with k=5 using Elbow Method.
Created clusters with various features and grouped them to target customers.
